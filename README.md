## How to use the simple platform? ##

Make sure that you installed the ArchC project ( [github.com/ArchC/ArchC] (https://www.github.com/ArchC/ArchC) ).

To compile and execute the platform:

```bash
make
./platform.x -- sw/hello_custom.elf```


When ``waiting for connection on port...`` appearson the current terminal, open a new terminal and type:


```bash
nc localhost 6000```
